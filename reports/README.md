# Reports

The `agentos validate` command can write a human-readable and machine-readable summary of deployment health checks.
Typical outputs (when enabled by the CLI/config):

- `summary.json` — structured results for tooling/automation
- `summary.md` — operator-friendly report

Note: This folder is optional; if you prefer, write reports under a timestamped directory (e.g., `reports/2025-12-20T12-00-00Z/`).
