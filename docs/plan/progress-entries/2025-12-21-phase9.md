## 2025-12-21 — Phase 9

**Completed**
- Added alerting stack (Prometheus + Blackbox Exporter + Alertmanager) that probes health endpoints.
- Added baseline alert rules: service-down and slow-probe.
- Added opt-in Nginx edge rate limiting configs per service.
- Added Phase 9 operator docs and plan update.

**Next**
- Decide whether to add native `/metrics` endpoints and first SLO dashboards (Phase 10+).
- Add mTLS option for federation (gateway/edge termination first).
