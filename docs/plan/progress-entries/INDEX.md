# Progress Entries Index

This folder contains short, human-readable progress snapshots.

## Date convention
- The **header date** inside each file is authoritative.
- Filenames are treated as a convenience and may be normalized later via `scripts/normalize_progress_entry_dates.sh`.

## Entries
- `2025-12-21-phase7.md`
- `2025-12-21-phase8.md`
- `2025-12-21-phase9.md`

If a filename date is in the future (e.g., created during planning), normalize it when you cut a release tag or when you want the repo timeline to be clean.
