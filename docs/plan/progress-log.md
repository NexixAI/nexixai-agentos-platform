# Progress Log — AgentOS v1.02

Append-only log of execution progress. Keep entries short and factual.

## 2025-12-20
**Completed**
- Restored the full Phase 0–9 execution plan structure in `docs/plan/agentos-v1.02-execution-plan.md` (some earlier bundles unintentionally truncated the plan file).

**Next**
- Continue Phase 2: align Stack A OpenAPI to the Schemas Appendix, then complete Stack B + Federation OpenAPI.

**Notes**
- Rule going forward: OpenAPI/phase bundles must not replace the plan with a shortened template; only update the “Current status” section.
